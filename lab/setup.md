# Lab setup

## Find a partner

1. Find a classmate to be your partner for this lab.
2. Sit together.

## Set up a fork

1. Create a `GitHub` account.
2. Go to the [original repo](https://github.com/inno-se-toolkit/lab-01-market-product-and-git) (repository).
3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the original repo.
4. Go to your fork. The `URL` should be like `https://github.com/<your-username>/lab-01-market-product-and-git`.
5. If you see a lock sign near your fork name, [make your fork public](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-a-repositorys-visibility).

> [!NOTE]
> Continue working in your fork.

## Enable issues

Go to `Settings` -> `General` -> `Features`.

Check the box near `Issues`.

## Add a classmate as a collaborator

In your repo `Settings` -> `Collaborators` -> `Add people`, add your partner as a collaborator.

Your partner should add you as a collaborator in their repo.

Make sure your collaborator has accepted the invitation sent to their email.

It's OK if your collaborator can't change `Settings` in your repo.

## Protect your `main` branch

Branch protection prevents accidental pushes directly to `main`.
This enforces the PR workflow and ensures all changes are reviewed.

1. Go to your fork on `GitHub`.
2. Go to `Settings`.
3. Go to `Code and automation`.
4. Go to `Rules`.
5. Go to `Rulesets`.
6. Go to `New ruleset`.
7. Go to `Add branch ruleset`.
8. Set:

   1. `Ruleset Name`: `push`
   2. `Enforcement status`: `Active`
   3. `Target branches` -> `Add target` -> `Include default branch`
   4. Rules:
      - [x] `Restrict deletions`
      - [x] `Require a pull request before merging`:
         - `Required approvals`: `1`
         - `Require conversation resolution before merging`
         - `Allowed merge methods`: `Merge`.
      - [x] Block force pushes

## Set up `Git`

[Install `Git`](https://git-scm.com/install/).

On your computer, configure `Git`:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `<your-name>` with a name and `<your-email>` with an email that you want to see in the commits.
>
> See [docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-username).

```console
git config --global user.name '<your-name>'
# example: git config --global user.name 'John Doe'
```

```console
git config --global user.email '<your-email>'
# example: git config --global user.name 'johndoe@gmail.com'
```

## Install `VS Code`

1. Install [`VS Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

   We chose this editor because it has built-in AI features and many useful [extensions](./appendix/vs-code.md#extensions).

    ```console
    git clone <fork-url>
    ```

5. Click `CHANGES` to uncollapse that panel.
6. Click `Clone Repository`.
7. Click `Clone from GitHub`.
8. Allow the extension to sign in.
9. Find your fork in the list.
10. Click it.
11. Choose a directory where to clone the repo.
12. Confirm the choice.

## Open the repo in `VS Code`

1. Open `VS Code`.
2. [Open the `Command Palette`](../lab/appendix/vs-code.md#command-palette).
3. Run `File: Open Folder...`
4. Find the directory `lab-01-market-product-and-git` that stores the clone of your fork.
5. Make sure there is `README.md` inside that directory.

## Set up `VS Code` extensions

1. [Install recommended `VS Code` extensions](./appendix/vs-code.md#install-recommended-extensions).
2. Sign in to accounts.
    1. Go to the [`Activity Bar`](./appendix/vs-code.md#activity-bar).
    2. Click the icon `Accounts`.

## Optional enhancements to make your life easier

### Coding: Set up a coding agent

A coding agent can help you write code, explain concepts, and debug issues.

See [Coding agents](./appendix/coding-agents.md).

### Shell: Set up the prompt

Starship shows your current `Git` branch, status, and other useful info directly in your terminal prompt.

Install [`Starship`](https://github.com/starship/starship#-installation).

### `VS Code`: Check `GitLens`

`GitLens` shows commit history, blame annotations, and branch visualization right inside `VS Code`.

#### Look at the commit graph

1. Go to the [`Status Bar`](../lab/appendix/vs-code.md#status-bar):
1. Click the icon `Visualize commits on the Commit Graph`.
1. Make sure you can see the commit graph.

#### Inspect remotes and the current branch

#### (Optional) Learn more about `GitLens`

See [`GitLens` features](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-features/).

### Repo: Create a label for tasks

> [!TIP]
> If you create the `task` label before creating issues, your issues will have this label automatically as configured in the [issue form](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml).

[Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) help you filter and organize issues.

With a `task` label, you can see in one view all lab tasks that have this label.

In the repo -> `Issues` -> `Labels`, create a new label:

1. Click `New label`.
2. Name: `task`.
3. Click `Create label`.

Then [add this label](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/53473#discussioncomment-5697478) to some of your task issues.

Next, in the repo -> `Issues`, filter by the label:

1. Click `Labels`.
2. In the `Filter labels` input area, write `task`.
3. Click the suggested label.
4. You'll see all issues that have this label.
