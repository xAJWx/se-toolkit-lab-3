# `Git workflow` for tasks

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure is based on the [`GitHub flow`](../appendix/github.md#github-flow).

```text
Issue ➜ Branch ➜ Commits ➜ PR ➜ Review ➜ Merge
```

Here's this workflow in the context of repos:

## Create a `Lab Task` issue

[Create an issue](../appendix/github.md#create-an-issue) using the `Lab Task` [issue form](../appendix/github.md#issue-form).

## Switch to the `main` branch

[Switch to the `main` branch](../appendix/git-vscode.md#switch-to-the-main-branch) in `VS Code`.

## Detect conflicts

[Detect conflicts with the `origin/main`](../appendix/git-vscode.md#detect-conflicts).

## Pull changes from `origin/main`

[Pull changes from the `main` branch in your fork on `GitHub`](../appendix/git-vscode.md#pull-changes-from-originbranch-name).

## Pull changes from `origin/main` and rebase

You may see some errors and messages about conflicts after pulling.

You need to rebase your local commits in your local `<branch-name>` onto the commits from `origin/<branch-name>`.

However, you can get conflicts if commits from `origin/<branch-name>` modified the same lines of text in files as your local commits but in a different way.

In this case, you should resolve conflicts.

Steps:

1. [Pull and rebase using `GitLens`](#pull-and-rebase-using-gitlens)
2. [Resolve conflicts using `GitLens`](#resolve-conflicts-using-gitlens)

### Pull and rebase using `GitLens`

When you rebase, your local commits are placed on top of the commits from `origin/main`.

1. [Run using the `Command Palette`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-command-palette):
   `GitLens: Pull`
2. [Select](../appendix/vs-code.md#select-an-option-from-a-list)
   `Pull with Rebase`.
3. You're done if `GitLens` doesn't show any error.

### Resolve conflicts using `GitLens`

Continue resolving conflicts if you see an error like this:

<img alt="Pull Error" src="../images/appendix/gitlens/pull-error.png" style="width:400px"></img>

1. [Open the `Source Control`](../appendix/vs-code.md#open-the-source-control).
2. Go to `Merge Changes`.
3. Click a file.
4. Click `Resolve in Merge Editor`.
5. Accept changes that you like more.
6. Click `Complete Merge`.
7. [Open the `Source Control`](../appendix/vs-code.md#open-the-source-control).
8. Click `Continue`.
9. This should be resolved.
10. There may be other conflicts.
11. `VS Code` can show something like `Rebasing (1/3)` and `Cancel`.
12. Click that `Cancel`.
13. Repeat steps.

## Switch to a new branch

[Create a new branch and switch to it](../appendix/git-vscode.md#switch-to-a-new-branch).

We'll refer to the name of this branch as `<branch-name>`.

## Edit files

[Edit files](../appendix/vs-code.md#editor) using `VS Code` to produce changes.

## Commit

[Commit changes](../appendix/git-vscode.md#commit-changes) to the `<branch-name>` to complete the task.

## (Optional) Undo commits

[Undo commits](../appendix/git-vscode.md#undo-commits) if necessary.

## Publish the branch

[Publish the branch](../appendix/git-vscode.md#publish-the-branch) with your changes.

## Push more commits

[Push more commits](../appendix/git-vscode.md#push-more-commits) to the published branch if necessary.

## Create a PR to `main` in your fork

[Create a PR](../appendix/github.md#create-a-pr) replacing:

- `<repo-owner-username>` with `inno-se-toolkit`;
- `<repo-name>` with `se-toolkit-lab-2`;
- `<your-username>` with your `GitHub` username;
- `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch that you want to merge in the PR.

## Get a PR review

[Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members) a review of the PR from the collaborator (see [PR review rules](#pr-review-rules)).

Get the collaborator's comments and address them, e.g., make fixes or ask to clarify the comment.

Get the collaborator to approve the PR.

### PR review rules

3. [Approve](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request#submitting-your-review) the PR when all relevant acceptance criteria are met.
